* ClientState vs MetaContext
To handle unsaved changes ClientState uses IDCache.  Main UOP has only already persisted data in MetaContext.  Several useful algorithms are off of MetaContext.   It would be good to have a MetaContext based on some kind of cached ByNameId tied to IDCache perhaps.  The alternate would be duplicating some algorithms for ClientState.
** Plan
*** ByNameId CachedByNameId subclass
**** TODO create
**** TODO substitute for IDNameMap in ClientState
**** TODO ensure initialized with ClientState init
**** TODO ensure adjusted on commit / abort
**** TODO expose as ClientState metacontext
** Trade-offs and Challenges
